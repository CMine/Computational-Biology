1.  Characterizing Nucleotide Frequencies In Bacteriophage Lambda
The goal was to quickly determine the frequency of base nucleotides A, C, G, T present in a given DNA sequence and present a visual representation of our findings.

2. Harnessing Transition Matrices and The Odds Ratio For CpG Island Identification
Verify the ability to establish probabilistic models of sequences computationally using Transition Matrices and the Odd Ratios to find CpG islands in a given DNA sequence.
